## Overview

HomeBuyHome is an iOS mobile app to easily compare multiple home listings and distinguish key attributes to make an informed home-purchase decision.  

## Problem Statement

Purchasing a new home is a huge decision that will have implications, positive or negative, for years to come. There's lack of mobile apps that give home buyers a way to compare, side-by-side, homes and key factors.
